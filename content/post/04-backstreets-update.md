Small progress report this week!

<!--more-->

For the time left for [js13k](https://js13kgames.com/) I'll stick to working on my jam entry, which now has a name **backstreetsback** and a repository [github.com/lislis/backstreetsback](https://github.com/lislis/backstreetsback).

## What happened since last week?

I replaced the jpg-brick-texture on my walls with a fragment shader one. The advantage is that it's super tiny, the drawback is that my shader-foo is not strong enough to be convincing :/

So I decided to move away from the creepy, horror-like setting I thought of in the beginning and go for a more pop-art-abstract kind of style.

That works even nicer with another idea I had: originally I wanted to draw the [boys as the monsters](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qV5o0EcAgKY/maxresdefault.jpg) they play in the video of 'Everybody'. Although that would be cool, I would once again have to deal with bigger pixel (or maybe vector?) assets. I don't have space for that if I also want some audio! Plus, I assume that more people know the song than the video to the song and then the joke would not work. Mep.

Luckily, a had a (what I think) pretty good idea: instead of displaying (and collecting etc.) the 5 boys, I could decorate the level with snippets from the lyrics. Very iconic lyrics, more lines means more collectables, plus it fits better with the abstract style! Sweet!

Next to some thinking and planning, I also made the automatic camera movement with checkpoints work. Huzzah!

But: two weeks to go and the biggest chunks are still left to be done!
