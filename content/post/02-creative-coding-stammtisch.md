I attended the [Creative Code Stammtisch](https://www.meetup.com/creativeCodeBerlin/events/hgqjfryzlbdb/) in Berlin for the first time last Friday.

<!--more-->

It's a very nice evening format where coders, artists and other professions come together and share their work.

People who want to present something get 10 minutes and the projector and then a QA or discussion follows.

I presented [FigFrag](https://gitlab.com/lislis/figfrag), my little fragment shader environment that I wrote for Heart of Clojure. And got a link to another awesome looking shader tutorial (by [fragment foundry](http://hughsk.io/fragment-foundry/chapters/01-hello-world.html)).

You can see the notes for this event and previous events in their dropbox paper under [https://paper.creativecode.berlin](//paper.creativecode.berlin).
(Collaborative note taking during a meetup is a genious idea, too!)

There were two presentations about visual programming languages and environments, that I had never heard of, but they all had some pretty neat results to show.

Also, [OpenRNDR](https://openrndr.org/), a creative coding framework in Kotlin made an appearance
