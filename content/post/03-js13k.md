[JS13k 2019](https://js13kgames.com/) has begun last week!

<!--more-->


JS13k is a game jam where you have 4 weeks to create a game in JavaScript that should not be larger than 13kB including all assets.

I'll try to run in the webXR category again (formerly known as webVR), where in addition to your 13kB of game logic and assets, you get to use an XR engine.

My tool of choice is [a-frame](https://aframe.io/) since I've worked with it before and don't have the time to learn a new thing.

## Ideas!

This year's theme is **back** and after some brainstorming I came up with a railshooter-like game around the [Backstreet Boys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backstreet_Boys) and their video to [Everybody](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6M6samPEMpM).

Getting everything I thought of into 13kB will be tough, but I think the idea is fun anyway, so I'll try and finish the game and then try harder to squeeze everything into 13kB.

Here is a first glimpse:
