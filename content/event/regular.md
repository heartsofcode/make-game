The regular Monday hangout is a relaxed evening for working on your own project or to just hang out and see what others are up to.
Come and ask questions, brainstorm, draw, (3d) print, solder, program or drink Mate as much as you like.

It happens every Monday unless noted otherwise. Subscribe to the [iCal calendar](/event/index.ics) for updates.

The entrance is a bit hard to find, look out for signs.
