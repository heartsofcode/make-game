Woof! Time flies or what?! Unbelievable!

I'll just quickly want to write down a little summary of what happened in the last months of 2019 and give a little outlook on what is planned in 2020. Let's get going!

We've had a few visitors who had cool projects in mind and I'd to talk a little bit about those. They make great examples of what you *could* do at make+game.

## Pointing and clicking

One of them was about making a point and click game in [ThreeJS](https://threejs.org/) in the style of [Monkey Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_Island_(series)) as a personal website. So 2D point and click art in 3D space! How would that look like? Very interesting, probably! The big hurdle was obviously getting started with 3D development in ThreeJS. The documentation is really good, but aside from the first '[spinning cube](https://threejs.org/docs/#manual/en/introduction/Creating-a-scene)' tutorial, you kind of have to know what you are doing. After some searching the interwebs we found an almost complete tutorial of [making a game in ThreeJS on GitHub](https://github.com/saucecode/threejs-demos). Not bad for starters!

## Inverse Fonts

We also had a fashion design student who wanted to design a font that consists of only the inverse space of the letters. Next, an algorithm should layout the letters to form words. Think of instead of forming a word from left to right and on one axis, the letters could be rotated, stacked or put together otherwise to form a word. Now comes the fashion part: the shape patterns formed by the words should be used as a pattern on garments. How cool! But first things first, the algorithm needs to be figured out...

## Stepper fun

We also thought of a hardware project for our space: an instant ramen vending machine! Something like this [arduino based snack vending machine](https://blog.arduino.cc/2016/06/29/venduino-is-a-diy-arduino-vending-machine/) but for noodles. We already bought some arcade buttons and stepper motors, but we ran into issues actually making a stepper turn. Until yesterday we realized that we were looking at the plan of a slightly different relay and had to switch two pins. But then it worked! I hope we can make more progress with this project in the coming weeks.

## What's up in 2020?

Enough with the past (or the present), to the future!

Some thing that I want to do regularly is introductory workshops. I started make+game to bring together all of the topics that I'm interested in and find people who like those, too. But opening up knowledge on these sometimes very specific topics is important as well. So, I'll try and do just that and I'm writing it on the internet so the internet can keep me accountable.

Also, I've managed to get this Hugo page to generate an iCal file, so there is an event calendar you can subscribe to. The link is in the main navigation. Next is a proper web view.

That's it for now!
