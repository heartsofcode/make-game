      <description>Woof! Time flies or what?! Unbelievable!
I&amp;rsquo;ll just quickly want to write down a little summary of what happened in the last months of 2019 and give a little outlook on what is planned in 2020. Let&amp;rsquo;s get going!
We&amp;rsquo;ve had a few visitors who had cool projects in mind and I&amp;rsquo;d to talk a little bit about those. They make great examples of what you could do at make+game.</description>
