This Monday (March 2nd, 2020) we're doing a little introduction to physical computing with Arduino and sensors!
No prior knowledge required (but a little programming knowledge will be useful ;))!

## What?

What are microcontrollers and why is programming them different from programming regular computers?
What is even electricity and how do circuits work? How do I connect a sensor or other parts as inputs for my project? Come and find out!

We have a limited amount of Arduino micro-controllers, sensors and cables and whatever else we might need. Already have stuff lying around? Feel free to bring your own micro-controllers and other equipment you have at home collecting dust and work with those!

Definitely bring your computer and ideally install the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) beforehand.

## Schedule

- 19:30 Presentation start. Arrive before this!
- 20:15 Your first hello blinky world!
- 20:30 Introducing sensors
- 21:00 Time for experiments
- 22:00 We all go home

Since we'll have a presentation in the beginning, please make sure you'll arrive on time! The entrance can be hard to find, so please plan in an extra 10 minutes to walk around aimlessly.
