This is make+game, your new favorite Monday evening get-together!

<!--more-->

Imagine a co-learning and co-making event that is all about **hardware**, **electronics**, (video) **games** and **interactive interactive**. And everything that fits in that space!

I'm excited just writing about it!

We're part of the [Heart of Code hackspace](//heartofcode.org) for women*, that means if you identify as a women make+game event is for you!

## Can you get more precise?

No idea what all these words in the introduction mean?

Here is some inspirational videos that will hopefully make it clearer:

It's really up to you!
If you're interested and just started out in any of these (or more?) fields and not sure if this is for you: come by and learn with us! We are all constantly learning and don't know what we're doing. Promise!

Work on a small project, create or follow a tutorial or document things for your personal portfolio. There is always a lot to do!


## What else?

I will try to write updates on projects that are being worked at make+game every week. It's always nice to have a little documentation of progress!

Besides that I want to write about other events in the realm of make+game and other cool stuff that might be of interest to the target group. We will see!

Happy make+gameing!
