# make+game

Website for the hardware-hacking and game-making and everything in between evening at Heart of Code.

## Setup

This is a [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) website, please see their [installation guides](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing) for ... installation guides.

Once you have Hugo installed, you can run a dev server with `hugo serve`, or simply build the site with `hugo build`. To include events that are in the future, add the `--buildFuture` flag. This is also what the Netlify build runs.

## Content

As of right now there are two types of contents, **posts** for blog posts and **events** for calendar events, that will render both an HTML representation and an .ics file that you can subscribe to in a calendar client of your choice!

Future &tm; plans include **projects** for project description and documentation and **material** for learning materials, tutorials and so forth.

## Theme

Currently using the [tranquilpeak theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-tranquilpeak-theme/) but the plan is to move to a less buggy or even a custom theme.
